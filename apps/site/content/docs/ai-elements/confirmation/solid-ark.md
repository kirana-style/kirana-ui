# Confirmation

<!-- ::preview item="confirmation-demo" height="410" combinations="solid/ark" -->

Confirmation asks the person for a yes or no before a tool runs. The question is an [Item](/docs/components/item) with Deny and Approve buttons. Once the person answers, the call becomes a [Tool](/docs/ai-elements/tool) line.

## Installation

Confirmation is built with the [Item](/docs/components/item) and [Button](/docs/components/button) components.

<!-- ::installation name="item button" combinations="solid/ark" -->

## Usage

The code under the preview is the whole example, in one file.

## AI SDK

While the part is `approval-requested`, answer with the approval id. Pass `sendAutomaticallyWhen: lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithApprovalResponses` so the chat continues once every approval has an answer.

```ts showLineNumbers
chat.addToolApprovalResponse({
  id: part.approval.id,
  approved: true,
})
```

```ts showLineNumbers
new Chat({
  sendAutomaticallyWhen: lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithApprovalResponses,
})
```

Approve streams the tool output. Deny streams `output-denied`. Either way, the part becomes a Tool line.

See [Tool](/docs/ai-elements/tool#approval).

## AI SDK Helper

To script an approval with [`createChat`](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/helpers/ai-sdk) (`@shadcn/helpers`), set `needsApproval` on the tool. The `output` streams after approval, and the next agent turn reads `toolCall.approved`.

```ts showLineNumbers
const chat = createChat()
  .user("Clean up the build folder.")
  .assistant(({ writer }) => {
    writer.tool("runCommand", {
      input: { command: "rm -rf dist" },
      needsApproval: true,
      output: { stdout: "" },
    })
  })
  .assistant(({ writer, toolCall }) => {
    writer.text(
      toolCall?.approved
        ? "Removed the dist folder."
        : "Okay, I left the dist folder in place."
    )
  })
```
